title: MTA Station Analysis
---

<div class="message">
The objective of this Data Science project was to leverage publicly available MTA turnstile station data in order to develop recommendations on how to reach a target audience of individuals who are likely to both attend and donate to a women's technology gala next June.
</div>

Assumptions:

- April 2018 data used to predict subway traffic for April 2019
- 12 resources available to collect e-mail signatures at subway entrances

Model Inputs Include:

- [Station entries](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)
- [IRS Donor Data](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/15zpallagi.csv)
- [Tech Company Mappings](http://startupguide.nyc/)

###Maps

**Donor Penetration**

We identified 33 out of 131 zip codes in NYC where the percentage of individuals claiming charitable deductions was greater than 38%.

**Technology Presence**

We identified 26 zip codes with tech companies, 8 of which had 5 or more.

**MTA Stations by Zip Code**

We mapped the technology companies in orange alongside the subway stations.

Combining the donor penetration and technology presence in the area, we targeted the following 6 zip codes:

    <tr>
      <th>Zip Code</th>

      <th># of Tech Companies</th>

Combining zip code data with our MTA turnstile dataset, we identified 22 stations located within the 6 target zip codes.  Of the unit / stations combinations, Union Square and Penn Station had the highest traffic where we will focus our efforts[^fn-additional_considerations] .

After reviewing turnstile entries for these two stations by day and by hour, we recommend deploying our street teams evenly between the two stations on Wednesday and Thursday nights during the evening commute.

{% highlight text %}
[^fn-additional_considerations] To deploy additional resources we would recommend the Transportation Hub which combines the WTC PATH with Fulton Center subway stations to yield the third highest foot traffic overall.  Both stations had been excluded from our subset as they did not meet the tech company criteria for 5 companies in the zip code, however, they do have high donor percentages at 43.8% and 33.7%, respectively.  We believe this station provides a good cross section of our population, connecting NJ PATH, to the 123 and 456 to Brooklyn and would provide ample space for us to set up tables and establish a presence for soliciting e-mail signatures.
